## REST

Stands for representational state transfer and this type of architecture is contrained by six principles:

- Client-Server architecture
- Statelessness
- Cacheablity
- Layered System
- Code on Demand
- Uniform interface


## RESTful API

Defined as an API that abides by the above principles.

## Web Services

"These web services use HTTP methods to implement the concept of REST architecture. A RESTful web service usually defines a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), which is a service that provides resource representation such as JSON and a set of HTTP Methods."

"n a web service, the Web technology such as HTTP—originally designed for human-to-machine communication—is utilized for machine-to-machine communication, more specifically for transferring machine-readable file formats such as XML and JSON.

In practice, a web service commonly provides an object-oriented web-based interface to a database server, utilized for example by another web server, or by a mobile app, that provides a user interface to the end user. Many organizations that provide data in formatted HTML pages will also provide that data on their server as XML or JSON, often through a web service to allow syndication, for example Wikipedia's Export. Another application offered to the end user may be a mashup, where a web server consumes several web services at different machines, and compiles the content into one user interface."


## AJAX

Ajax is short for Asynchronous Javascript and XML, which is a set of web development techniques rather than an actual programming language. Ajax is widely used in client-side programming (e.g. Javascript) to allow for data to be sent and received to and from a database / server.
